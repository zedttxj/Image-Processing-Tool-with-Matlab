  - PDilation does not satisfy cancellative properties. That is, knowing `A ⊕ B = A ⊕ C` does not imply `B = C`.  
  - A counterexample is shown later (Case 1).
  - Convolution-like operator: We define a custom `(∘,⊕)`-convolution operator using **∘** as the combining operation and **⊕** as the accumulation operation. 
Assume that `A ⊕ B = Cs`. We can define PDilation as follow:
