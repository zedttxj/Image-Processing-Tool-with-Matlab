## EXTRA.DILATIONSET and dilationSet Functions with Added Customized Functions  

### 1. **matrixToCoords(A)**
   - **Purpose**: This function converts a matrix (like `A`) into a set of coordinates where the value is `1`.
   - **How it works**: The function scans through the matrix, identifying positions with `1`s, and stores these positions as coordinates in a 2D array.
   - **Example**:
     ```matlab
     A = [
       1 1 0 0;
       0 1 0 1
     ];
     coords = ImageProcessor.matrixToCoords(A);
     disp(coords);
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     >> 
     0     0
     0     1
     1     1
     1     3
     ```  

### 2. **coordsToMatrix(B)**
   - **Purpose**: Takes a set of coordinates (like those generated by `matrixToCoords`) and converts them back into a binary matrix where `1`s are placed at the corresponding positions.
   - **How it works**: It initializes a zero matrix of the appropriate size, then iterates over the list of coordinates, placing `1`s at each position.
   - **Example**:
     ```matlab
     C = [0 0; 0 1; 1 1; 1 3];
     matrix = ImageProcessor.coordsToMatrix(C);
     disp(matrix);
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     >> 
     1     1     0     0
     0     1     0     1
     ```  

### 3. **dilationSet(A, B)**
   - **Purpose**: Performs the dilation operation between two sets, `A` and `B`. It calculates the set `A ⊕ B = { (a,b) + (c,d) | (a,b) ∈ A, (c,d) ∈ B }`, adding every element of `B` to every element of `A`. 
   - **How it works**: The function expands both sets using `ndgrid`, then adds their coordinates to create a new set of dilated coordinates.
   - **Example**:
     ```matlab
     A = [0 0; 0 1; 1 1; 1 3];  % Example set A
     B = [0 0; 0 1; 1 0];       % Example set B
     C = ImageProcessor.dilationSet(A, B);
     disp(C);
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     >> 
     0     0
     0     1
     0     2
     1     0
     1     1
     1     2
     1     3
     1     4
     2     1
     2     3
     ```  

### EXTRA.DILATIONSET Function and its Comparison to EXTRA.DILATION

The function `EXTRA.DILATIONSET` operates in a way that is conceptually similar to the function `EXTRA.DILATION`. Both of these functions can be considered **homomorphic** (set that has negative coordinates can't be converted into matrix), meaning they perform a similar dilation operation, but on different data structures. The same concept applies to the relationship between `dilationSet` and the **standard dilation on matrices**.

- **Important Note**: Unlike `EXTRA.DILATION`, which is designed to handle dilation on matrices of various dimensions, `EXTRA.DILATIONSET` is specifically optimized for working with 2D logical matrices in the **set form** (where elements are either `0` or `1` in matrix form are converted into set of coordinates).  

### Test Flow

This process ensures that the dilation operation is applied correctly, and the final result is returned as a matrix. The output is a new logical matrix that represents the dilation of the specially transformed input sets.

1. **Define the sets A and B** as matrices.
2. **Convert the matrices into coordinates** using `matrixToCoords`.
3. **Perform the dilation operation** between `A` and `B` using `EXTRA.DILATIONSET`.
4. **Convert the result back into a matrix** using `coordsToMatrix` and display it.
```matlab
A = [
    1 1 0 0;
    0 1 0 1
];

B = [
    0 1;
    1 0
];

disp(ImageProcessor.EXTRA.DILATION(A,B));

A = ImageProcessor.matrixToCoords(A);
B = ImageProcessor.matrixToCoords(B);

C = ImageProcessor.EXTRA.DILATIONSET(A,B);
C = ImageProcessor.coordsToMatrix(C);
disp(C);
```

- Output:

```
>> 
     1     1     1     0     0     0     0
     1     1     1     1     1     1     0
     0     1     1     1     1     1     1
     0     0     0     0     1     1     1

     1     1     1     0     0     0     0
     1     1     1     1     1     1     0
     0     1     1     1     1     1     1
     0     0     0     0     1     1     1
```  

### Summary:

- `EXTRA.DILATIONSET` = Works similarly to `EXTRA.DILATION`.
- `EXTRA.DILATIONSET` is **not suitable** for RGB images or matrices with multiple channels so you may have to manually separate the channels to calculate it.
- Both `EXTRA.DILATION` and `EXTRA.DILATIONSET` can be considered **homomorphic** in their operation.
