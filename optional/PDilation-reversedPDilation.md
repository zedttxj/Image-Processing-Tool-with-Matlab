# PDilation is non-injective
Like how Dilation is non-injective, PDilation is also non-injective. Hence, finding all `(A, B)` pairs that lead to a known result `Cs` is a set-inversion problem.
It's a nonlinear algebraic structure — something like:

```
(A, B) ↦ A ⊕ B  (where ⊕ is PDilation)
```
Now, solving the inverse problem:

Given D, find all (A, B) such that A ⊕ B = D.

Whis is exactly like convolution inversion but under max-plus algebra
