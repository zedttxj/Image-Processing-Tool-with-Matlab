## EXTRA.DILATION(binaryMatrix1, binaryMatrix2)

### Input:
- `binaryMatrix1` (2D or 3D logical): A binary image, with or without color channels (RGB).
- `binaryMatrix2` (2D or 3D logical): A binary structuring element (kernel), also with or without color channels.  

### Output:
- A **logical** 2D (grayscale) or 3D (RGB) **image** after dilation.  

### Explanation:
Dilation in matrix form is a well-known operation, but before applying it, we introduce a **special function** (called **MatrixDecomposition**) that transforms the input matrices. This function modifies both `A` and `B`, and apply **standard dilation** (as defined in most image processing books) to the transformed versions.  

### MatrixDecomposition Transformation
MatrixDecomposition works as follows (the actual code has different workflow that works in matrix-based dilation instead of set-based dilation):

1. **Extract the coordinates** of all `1` values in the matrix and represent them as ordered pairs `(x, y)`. The first coordinate always starts at `[0,0]` (zero-based index).
   - Example: Given the matrix `A`:
     ```matlab
     A = [
       1 1 0 0;
       0 1 0 1
     ];
     ```
     The extracted set of coordinates is `{[0,0], [0,1], [1,1], [1,3]}`.

2. **Compute a new transformed set** satisfying:  
{(a,b) + (c,d) + ... | (a,b), (c,d), ... ∈ A and (a,b) ≠ (c,d) ≠ ...}
where `...` can be empty or multiple elements of `A`.

3. **Convert this transformed set back into a matrix** representation.

### Comparison Between Set-Based and Matrix-Based Dilation  

#### Set-Based Dilation:
In set notation, the **dilation of two sets** `A` and `B` is defined as:  

A⊕B={ (a,b) + (c,d) | (a,b) ∈ A, (c,d) ∈ B }  

For every point `(a,b)` in `A`, we add all points `(c,d)` from `B` to generate the dilated result.  

#### Matrix-Based Dilation (Efficient Form):
- Instead of iterating over sets, **matrix dilation** is efficiently computed using **convolution operations** or **max filtering**, where a **structuring element (kernel)** is applied to the binary image.
- **MatrixDecomposition as Multiple Dilations**: We can think of the **MatrixDecomposition** as a series of dilations for each element in the set, where the dilation operator ⊕ applies to each element in the set 𝐴. For each element, we consider the set that contains the coordinate [0,0] (the first coordinate) and the element itself so that ⊕ can be applied. The special function then becomes the **Riemann Dilation sum** of these dilations (like how `+` has **Riemann sum**, ⊕ has **Riemann Dilation sum**). Consider this example:
  - Example: Generating Subsets Using Dilation
  
    Consider a set  
    **A = {a, b, c}**  
    Normally, we could generate subsets by toggling bits (e.g., using binary representation), but instead, we use the **dilation operator** (⊕):
  
    - Step 1: Start with the Base Set  
      S₀ = {[0,0]}  
    This represents the empty set as a starting point.
    
    - Step 2: Apply Dilation with Each Element  
    
      - First dilation with element a:  
      S₁ = S₀ ⊕ {[0,0], a} = {[0,0], a}  
    
      - Second dilation with element b:  
      S₂ = S₁ ⊕ {[0,0], b} = {[0,0], a, b, a+b}
    
      - Third dilation with element c:  
      S₃ = S₂ ⊕ {[0,0], c} = {[0,0], a, b, c, a+b, a+c, b+c, a+b+c}
  
    - **Resulting Set:**  
    After three dilations, we have generated all possible subsets of 𝐴, mimicking how binary toggling would work.  

- Effects: This **reduces computation time** from `O(2^(|A|))` (where `|A|` is the length of set A or the number of `1`s of matrix A) in the set-based approach to `O((max(rows(𝐴)) x max(cols(𝐴)))⁴)` for the `matrixDecomposition` function that transforms the input matrices.
- Recommendation:
  - Use Matrix-Based Dilation when `|𝐴|` is large enough (ideally below 676) and `max(rows(𝐴))` or `max(cols(𝐴))` is not too big.
  - Use Set-Based Dilation (introduced in the below section) when `|𝐴|` is small enough (ideally below 36).  

- Example code:
  ```matlab
  tic;
  B = ImageProcessor.readImage('test.png');
  A = B(200:205,200:205,:) > 160;
  B = B(200:225,200:225,:) > 160;
  t = ImageProcessor.EXTRA.DILATION(B,A);
  imshow(t);
  elapsedTime = toc;
  disp(elapsedTime);
  disp("Size of input image: " + strjoin(arrayfun(@num2str, size(B), 'UniformOutput', false), ' '));
  disp("Size of output image: " + strjoin(arrayfun(@num2str, size(t), 'UniformOutput', false), ' '));
  ```

  A = B(200:205,200:205,:) > 160;
  B = B(200:215,200:215,:) > 160;
  t = ImageProcessor.EXTRA.DILATION(B,A);
  imshow(t);
  elapsedTime = toc;
  disp(elapsedTime);
  disp("Size of input image: " + strjoin(arrayfun(@num2str, size(B), 'UniformOutput', false), ' '));
  disp("Size of output image: " + strjoin(arrayfun(@num2str, size(t), 'UniformOutput', false), ' '));

- **Fun fact**: No matter how you twist your input image, if it has enough entries that have value `1`, it will turn into the oval-like form with two pointed ends.
  - Note: I used `matrixDecomposition` here for demonstration. `EXTRA.DILATION` also works with 2D binary matrices.
