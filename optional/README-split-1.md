## ASf(A, d, ind)
- Input:
  - A (required): A 2D numerical matrix containing logical, integer, or decimal values.  
  - d (required): An integer representing the number of times the derivative is computed.  
  - ind (required): An integer representing the column or the columns of A to differentiate. Only that column is differentiated while the others remain unchanged.
- Output:
  - Jacobian (a 2D matrix): A 2D matrix representing the derivatives of `A` after `d` differentiations.
- Explanation: The `ASf` function computes the derivative of a matrix `A` a specified number of times (`d`). If an optional column index (`ind`) is provided, only that column is differentiated.
  Consider the polynomial:
  
  𝑃(𝑥,𝑦) = 3𝑥 + 5𝑦 + 5𝑥² + 4𝑦² + 𝑥³ + 4𝑥⁴  
  
  The coefficients of **x** and **y** are stored in a matrix form:  
  - The vector of **x-coefficients**: [3, 5, 1, 4]ᵀ → MATLAB notation: `[3; 5; 1; 4]`
  - The vector of **y-coefficients**: [5, 4, 0, 0]ᵀ → MATLAB notation: `[5; 4; 0; 0]`
  
  Thus, the **input matrix** `A` is:
  
  ```matlab
  [
    3 5;
    5 4;
    1 0;
    4 0
  ];
  ```
- Example code:
  ```matlab
  A = [
    3 5;
    5 4;
    1 1;
    4 0
  ];
  disp(ImageProcessor.ASf(A,2,1));
  ```
  - Run the Code:
    ```
    >> 
       6     5
      48     4
       0     1
    ```
    This result means that after two derivative operations, the only nonzero entry comes from the x-column, corresponding to the `6x + 48x²` term. The y-column stays the same, as expected.
- **NOTICE:** The input matrix A should **not** contain any constant values from the polynomial. As a result, the output will also ignore any constant values after differentiation.  

### PURPOSES
The `ASf` function was developed to observe **patterns in an image after differentiation**. Below is an example of how to use it for **image processing**:
  ```matlab
  A = [
    1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0;
    0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1;
    1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0;
  ];
  A = ImageProcessor.matrixToCoords(A);
  A = ImageProcessor.ASf(A,2,1);
  A = ImageProcessor.coordsToMatrix(A);
  B = ones([3 3]);
  imshow(ImageProcessor.Dilation1(A,B)); % Apply dilation to enhance visualization
  ```

## AJF(A, d, ind)
- Input:
  - A (required): A 2D numerical matrix containing logical, integer, or decimal values.  
  - d (required): An integer representing the number of times the derivative is computed.  
  - ind (optional): An integer (either 1 or 2). `1` indicates the function keeps **all** columns' positions the same. In the case of number `2`, columns' positions are reversed.
- Output:
  - Jacobian (a 2D matrix): A 2D matrix representing the derivatives of `A` after `d` differentiations.
- Explanation: The `AJF` function computes the derivative of a matrix **A** a specified number of times (`d`). It has similar inputs like `ASf` function.
- Example code:
  ```matlab
  A = [
    3 5;
    5 4;
    1 0;
    4 0
  ];
  disp(ImageProcessor.AJF(A,2,1));
  ```
- Run the code:
  ```matlab
  >> 
     6     0
    48     0
  ```
- Another example code:
  ```matlab
  A = [
    3 5;
    5 4;
    1 1;
    4 0
  ];
  disp(ImageProcessor.AJF(A,2,2));
  ```
- Run the Code:
  ```
  >> 
   6     6
   0    48
  ```
- **NOTICE:** The input matrix A should **not** contain any constant values from the polynomial. As a result, the output will also ignore any constant values after differentiation.
- Another example code:
  ```matlab
  A = [
    1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0;
    0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1;
    1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0;
  ];
  A = ImageProcessor.matrixToCoords(A);
  A = ImageProcessor.AJF(A,2,1);
  A = ImageProcessor.coordsToMatrix(A);
  B = ones([8 8]);
  imshow(ImageProcessor.Dilation1(A,B)); % Apply dilation to enhance visualization
  ```
